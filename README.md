# K_Means_Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters based on their features. When applied to a customer dataset, K-means clustering helps businesses identify distinct customer segments by analyzing patterns in purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant attributes. The algorithm works by initializing 'k' centroids, assigning customers to the nearest centroid, and iteratively updating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned customers. The result is a set of clusters, each representing a specific customer group with shared characteristics, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
